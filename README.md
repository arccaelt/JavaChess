This is a simple chess engine(just the chess game logic for know) written by me in Java to learn the language while doing something intresting.

It still lacks some features like:
  a. Castle support
  b. En passant support
  c. Better testing(more exhaustive tests)
  d. Chess tree traversals/more generation
