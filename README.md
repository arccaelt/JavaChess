This is a simple chess engine(just the chess game logic for now) written in Java to learn the language while doing something intresting.

It still lacks some features like:

  a. Castle support
  
  b. En passant support
  
  c. Better testing(more exhaustive tests)
  
  d. Chess tree traversals/more generation
